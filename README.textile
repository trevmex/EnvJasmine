h1. EnvJasmine: Jasmine test runner for EnvJS.

EnvJasmine allows you to run headless JavaScript tests.

h2. Creating New Specs

Add your Jasmine Spec files to the specs directory to be run.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to load the file you are planning to test as the first line of the spec file using the load("file.js"); function.

h2. Running JavaScript tests

To run the JavaScript test suite, execute the following:

bc. bin/run_all_tests.sh

To run an individual spec file, execute the following:

bc. bin/run_test.sh specs/[your spec file].js

h2. Adding Dependencies

Sometimes you will have libraries that you need to load for any of your JavaScript files to work. To make sure these are loaded before your tests are run, include them in the include/dependencies.js file using the load("file.js"); function.
